You know you’ll need a dashboard for administrators to add content, manage links and otherwise fairly simple data, and a front-end that turns that data into a brilliant, usable design. You may naturally turn to WordPress for its famous CMS, but you don’t really want to set up all those custom fields for content types other than Post or Page, plus you’re going to need some JSON data for the React/Angular/Vue JS front-end. Considering Ruby on Rails is an option, but the available CMS’s aren’t the easiest to use, and deploying one can be even harder. What should you do?

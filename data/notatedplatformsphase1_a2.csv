In fact, without CSS, website design simply can’t function. Website designing has gone through massive changes over time, and HTML and CSS have come a long way. With the introduction of HTML 5 and CSS 3, website design has moved to another level. Today the expectation is that designs meet the demands of many different platforms and screen sizes. These programs have stepped up to the challenge. For example, CSS 3 introduced the concept of media queries to create responsive websites, simplifying the lives of web developers everywhere. Still, there are many challenges when it comes to website design, including speed, performance, modularity and responsiveness. Luckily, CSS Frameworks are here to address all these challenges!

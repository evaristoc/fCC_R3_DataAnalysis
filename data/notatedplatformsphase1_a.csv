JavaScript Programming JavaScript Nested IF/ELSE Statements ;/od/problemsolving/a/modulobug.htm;;JavaScript (), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, object-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted client-side programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine. Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.

        jQuery is one of the great libraries that helped us overcome JavaScript browser issues when IE 6 and 7 were still around.
        Today, it may be a good choice to drop jQuery and its cousins, because modern browsers are pretty easy to deal with on their own.
        Using plain JavaScript will make your applications load and react blazingly fast.

You know you’ll need a dashboard for administrators to add content, manage links and otherwise fairly simple data, and a front-end that turns that data into a brilliant, usable design. You may naturally turn to WordPress for its famous CMS, but you don’t really want to set up all those custom fields for content types other than Post or Page, plus you’re going to need some JSON data for the React/Angular/Vue JS front-end. Considering Ruby on Rails is an option, but the available CMS’s aren’t the easiest to use, and deploying one can be even harder. What should you do?

It is comparable to features provided by Prototype.js and the Ruby language, but opts for a functional programming design instead of extending object prototypes. For example, Underscore.js''s _.each function delegates to the host environment''s native forEach implementation when present, or a compatible version when absent. The documentation refers to Underscore.js as "the tie to go along with jQuery''s tux, and Backbone.js''s suspenders." Underscore.js was created by Jeremy Ashkenas, who is also known for Backbone.js and CoffeeScript.'

You don’t often come across inline styling unless a site’s code hasn’t been touched since the 90s or early 2000s, but it’s certainly not unheard of. If you find yourself trying to do a redesign of an older site that contains inline styling within the HTML, you’ll almost absolutely find that overriding the inline styling can be a huge pain.

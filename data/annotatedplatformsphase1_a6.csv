Most projects had a very narrow scope.

Historically, JavaScript was used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage''s HTML, to be run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user''s web browser. Node.js enables JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting, and runs scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user''s web browser.

The JavaScript components complement Apache Cordova, the framework used for developing cross-platform mobile apps. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications.

Although the season begins by convention on June 1, there were no tropical depressions until July 23, and only four of the season''s seven depressions became tropical storms. Tropical Depression Three became Hurricane Alicia (satellite image pictured) on August 17 and made landfall in Texas the next day, breaking thousands of glass windows in Houston''s skyscrapers, killing 22 people and causing $1.7 billion in damage. The storm that became Hurricane Barry formed on August 25, crossed Florida, and made landfall near Brownsville, Texas, dissipating five days later. Hurricane Chantal stayed out at sea, and was absorbed by a front on September 15. Tropical Depression Six formed on September 19 and caused heavy rains in the Caribbean. Tropical Storm Dean, the final storm of the season, attained peak winds of 65 mph (105 km/h), and made landfall on the Delmarva Peninsula on September 29. (Full article...)

He succeeded his father, King Constantine I, in 1917, after the Entente Powers of World War I and followers of Eleftherios Venizelos pushed the king and his eldest son Crown Prince George into exile. Venizelos, as prime minister, became the effective ruler with the support of the Entente.

Under his reign, Greece expanded, following the victory of the Entente and the early stages of the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922. Alexander married the commoner Aspasia Manos in 1919, provoking a major scandal that forced the couple to leave Greece for several months.

The JavaScript components complement Apache Cordova, the framework used for developing cross-platform mobile apps. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications.

It is comparable to features provided by Prototype.js and the Ruby language, but opts for a functional programming design instead of extending object prototypes. For example, Underscore.js''s _.each function delegates to the host environment''s native forEach implementation when present, or a compatible version when absent. The documentation refers to Underscore.js as "the tie to go along with jQuery''s tux, and Backbone.js''s suspenders."

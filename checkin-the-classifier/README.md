# Comparing labels
## Visualizing labels
* Extract the labels (`organize_labels.py`)
* Visualize them (/d3 visualization)

## Working with the fcc urls dataset
* Some rows are not being parsed right
* `clean_rows_from_fcc.py` generates a dataset with good rows and bad rows

## Checking the overlap of UKWA and fcc urls
* `extract_urls.py` tests for a simple overlap in hostnames from fcc and UKWA

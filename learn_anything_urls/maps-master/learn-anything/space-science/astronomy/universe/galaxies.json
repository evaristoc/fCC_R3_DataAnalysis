      "note": "is a spiral galaxy approximately 780 kiloparsecs (2.5 million light-years) from Earth  It is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way  it is approximately 220,000 light years across, and it is the largest galaxy of the Local Group, which also contains the Milky Way, the Triangulum Galaxy, and other smaller galaxies  The Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are expected to collide in 4.5 billion years, eventually merging to form a giant elliptical galaxy or perhaps a large disc galaxy",
